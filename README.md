# FantasyLord
This python application has been used to create NBA teams on Dream11 - a gaming fantasy site .
Note: The project has been sold to "Dream11Masters" - a site which provides teams for NBA for Dream11 Matches. Hence , I can't upload codes for the project . Since the channel got very good results in NBA for small leagues , I requested them to allow me to upload the project outline and doc such that some of you could improve the model and come up with better fantasy teams and suggest me some other approcahes to imrove the model .
